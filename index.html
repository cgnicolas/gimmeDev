              <h1>The Mission</h1>
              <p>There are two types of people in life: Makers and Takers. The same is true of gimmeDev. Makers (the student developers) are, in essence, freelance software developers, while Takers (the people coming up with the ideas) are the ones paying the Makers to bring their ideas into this world. We're here to facilitate dreams, it's what we do.</p>

              <h1>About Us</h1>
              <p>gimmeDev, like most revolutions, is starting as an idea. We've realized that many Computer Science, Computer Engineering and Information Technology students are unable to find internships pertaining to their majors. It's not that these kids are dumb, or incompetent, but rather CS, CE, and IT internships are hyper competitive and filled almost immediately. We've also noticed that there are a lot of average, every day people with great ideas and no technical knowledge to do anything about them. gimmeDev is here to change that.</p>

              <h1>The App</h1>
              <p>Make sure to download our app on iOS and Android, so as a Taker, you can view the progress of your projects and as a Maker, you can look for projects to start.</p>
              <p>Messaging is even easier with the app as well, makers and takers can keep up with each other to ensure their projects get made the best way they can be.</p>

              <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
              <div class="questions">
                <h3>Q: I'm a freelance developer looking for some more experience and some money on the side, can I develop for you?</h3>
                <p>A: No. In order to sign up to be a Maker you will need a valid .edu e-mail address and must still be a college student.</p>
                <h3>Q: What's stopping a Maker from stealing my ideas as a Taker? Or worse, what's stopping another Taker from taking my ideas?</h3>
                <p>A: First off: only Makers can see your ideas. Unless you tell them in person, no Taker will ever be able to see your ideas. On top of that there are filters on our website that will allow you to keep tabs on who is viewing your ideas. Plus there'll be a bunch of legal mumbo jumbo that will protect you and your ideas from falling out of our hands :)</p>
                <h3>Q: How do I find Makers?</h3>
                <p>A: You don't, they find you. Makers will have a special search function built into their pages that will let them find your ideas. That is, of course, only if you let them. Eventually we hope to build in filters that will let you control exactly who you want to see it. In the meantime, we'll give you the option of keeping your ideas private.</p>
                <h3>Q: What do you get out of this?</h3>
                <p>A: It's not what WE get out of it, it's what YOU get out of it that we care about. Obviously we'll generate some dough based on the ideas our Makers and Takers come up with, but ultimately we want to see good, smart kids get the opportunities they so rightly deserve. What if the next Steve Jobs was out there but couldn't get a job because he "lacked experience"?</p>
                <h3>Q: Are you guys experts?</h3>
                <p>A: We're gettin' there. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
